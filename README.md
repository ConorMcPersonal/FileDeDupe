# FileDeDupe

Python helper to assist with de-duplicating blocks of files stored across different filesystems.  Uses folder structure walking to find files, then catalogues them by standard attributes.  Will later compare using hashes and even binary comparison.

Use case is blocks of family photographs that get copied around.
